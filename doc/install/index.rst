Prerequisites
-------------

The HILTI framework is developed on 64-bit Linux and MacOS, and will
most likely not work on other platforms.

To compile the framework, you need LLVM >= 3.4 and Clang >= 3.4 from
http://llvm.org, along with C++11-compatible standard libraries. This
combo can still be painful to set up; see below for help.

For unit testing:

* BTest (http://www.bro-ids.org/documentation-git/components/btest/README.html)

For generating the documentation:

* Sphinx 1.1 (http://sphinx.pocoo.org)::

    > easy_install sphinx

Getting the Code
----------------

Clone the git repository::

    > git clone git://www.icir.org/hilti

There's also a `mirror on github
<http://www.github.com/rsmmr/hilti>`_, which you can browse directly.

Installing LLVM/clang/libc++
----------------------------

If your OS doesn't come with a full LLVM/clang 3.4 setup that also
includes C++11 standard libraries, you'll need to compile it yourself.
This is a bit cumbersome unfortunately as one needs to compile clang
twice: once to boostrap and once with the right ``libc++``. Order of
the involved steps is important.

To make this easier, there's a script doing the necessary steps at
http://github.org/rsmmr/install-clang. See the installation
instructions there. In the following we assume that LLVM/clang is
available via ``PATH``.

Compiling the HILTI framework
-----------------------------

.. note:: HILTI doesn't have any installation framework yet, it's best
   run just right ouf of the repository. This will eventually change.

Compiling HILTI itself should be straight-forward once all
prerequisites are available. Just run make in the top-level
directory::

    > cd hilti
    > make

If you want to compile the included Bro plugin as well, you also need
to tell ``make`` where your Bro source tree is::

    > make BRO_DIST=/path/to/bro

As HILTI requires Bro's new plugin support, you will need to use the
current git master version of Bro.

If everything has worked right, there should now be a binary
``build/tools/hiltic`` afterwards (as well as a few others).

Next, you should see if two simple tests succeed::

     > cd tests
     > make hello-worlds
     all 2 tests successful

If there's a problem, ``diag.log`` will contain debugging output.

Just typing ``make`` in ``tests/`` will run the full test-suite.
Generally, the majority should succeeed. However, as things are still
in flux, some may be expected to fail.

As the HILTI tools aren't installed anywhere system-wide yet, you may
want to link to them from some directory that's in your ``PATH``, such
as::

     > export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
     > ln -s binpacpp/hilti2/build/tools/{hiltic,hilti-config,hilti-prof,binpac++} $HOME/bin
     > ln -s binpacpp/hilti2/build/tools/pac-driver/pac-driver $HOME/bin
     > ln -s binpacpp/hilti2/tools/hilti-build $HOME/bin

In the remainder of this documentation, we assume that these tools are
indeed found in the ``PATH``.

Docker Image
------------

As it can still be a bit tricky to set this is all up, there's also a
`Docker image <https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/rsmmr/hilti/>`_
available that comes with all pieces preinstalled (HILTI/Spicy,
Bro, LLVM/clang)::

    # docker run -i -t "rsmmr/hilti"
    HILTI 0.3-11
    BinPAC++ 0.3-11
    root@b18c7c5bc7e2:~# cat hello-world.pac2
    module Test;

    print "Hello, world!";
    root@b18c7c5bc7e2:~# pac-driver hello-world.pac2
    Hello, world!
    root@b18c7c5bc7e2:~# bro -NN Bro::Hilti

To build the Docker image yourself from the supplied Dockerfile, you
can use the make target::

    # make docker-build

Editors
-------

Syntax highlighting support for ``pac2`` files is available in
Vim and Emacs through the following plugins:

* `vim-spicy <https://github.com/blipp/vim-spicy>`_ for Vim; and

* `emacs-spicy <https://bitbucket.org/ldklinux/emacs-spicy>`_ for Emacs.
