Spicy: A Parser Generator For Network Protocols
==================================================

.. note::
   As you work with Spicy, you'll see a different name pop up
   sometimes: *BinPAC++*, which is Spicy's early name from when the
   project started. We have since renamed the system, as it is not
   really related to the original BinPAC system at all. However, as
   the renaming remains a work in progress, Spicy's tools and source
   code still use the old terminology for the most part.
