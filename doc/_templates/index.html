<h2>Download and Installation</h2>

<p>
The source code for both HILTI and Spicy is hosted at
<tt>git://git.icir.org/hilti</tt>. There's is also
<a href="http://www.github.com/rsmmr/hilti">a mirror on github</a>.
Follow the <a href="{{ pathto("install/index") }}">installation
instructions</a> to get it up and running.
</p>

<p>
We do not offer any further archives or packages for download right
now. However, there's a <a href="{{ pathto("install/index") }}#docker">Docker image</a>
that comes with everything preinstalled.
</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>
There is the
<a href="{{ pathto("manual")}}">start of a manual</a>. It's very
preliminary at this point, and very incomplete.
</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<dl>

<dt>What's the current implementation status?</dt>
<dd>
HILTI and Spicy are currently in prototype state; they aren't
production-ready yet. While they are functional and provide most of
the initially targeted functionality at this point, that doesn't mean
they are necessarily also stable, robust, efficient, portable,
user-friendly, or documented.
</dd>

<dt>Well, so when do you expect this all to be production-ready then?</dt>
<dd>
There's quite a bit still left to do, and it will require more
resources to make that happen. <a href="#contact">Let us know</a>
if you want to help.
</dd>

<dt>Which platforms are supported?</dt>
<dd>
We develop HILTI and Spicy on 64-bit Linux and MacOS; other
platforms are unlikely to work at the moment.
</dd>

<dt>Can I use Spicy with Bro?</dt>
<dd>
Yes, we have developed a
<a href="{{ pathto("binpac/bro/index")}}">Bro plugin</a>
that integrates Spicy transparently into
<a href="http://www.bro.org">Bro</a>.
</dd>

<dt>Oh, so is this all tied to Bro?</dt>
<dd>
No, not at all. While coming out of the
<a href="http://www.bro.org">Bro Project</a>,
HILTI and Spicy are standalone systems designed with generic C APIs
suitable for integration into a wide range of potentially quite
different applications.
</dd>

<dt>Alright, what's the license?</dt>
<dd>
HILTI and Spicy are open-source and come with a BSD license, which
allows for pretty much unrestricted use as long as you leave the
license header in place.
</dd>

<dt>I hear Spicy, I hear BinPAC++, that's confusing!?</dt>
<dd>
BinPAC++ used to be the working title of the parser generator. We have
since renamed the project to Spicy, as it's not actually related to
the original 2004 BinPAC system at all&mdash;it's aiming at the same
problem space but taking a completely different approach. As the
renaming remains work in progress, you'll still see lots of
evidence of that former name, including in tools (e.g.,
<tt>pac-driver</tt>)
and file extensions (<tt>*.pac2</tt>).
</dd>

<dt>Who's behind all this?</dt>
<dd>
HILTI and Spicy are developed by the 
<a href="http://www.icir.org">Networking and Security
Group</a> at the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu">International
Computer Science Institute</a>, a non-profit research institute
affiliated with the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of
California, Berkeley</a>. Development is funded in part by the
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a>.

<h2>About HILTI</h2>

<p>
When developing networking systems such as firewalls, routers, and
intrusion detection systems, one faces a striking gap between the ease
with which one can often describe a desired analysis in high-level
terms, and the tremendous amount of low-level implementation details
that one must still grapple with to come to a robust solution. HILTI
bridges this divide by providing an abstract execution environment for
deep, stateful network traffic analysis. It offers <em>platform</em>
to application developers that provides much of the low-level
functionality, without tying it to a specific analysis structure.
</p>

<p>
HILTI consists of two parts: (1) an <em>abstract machine model</em> that
caters specifically to the networking domain, directly supporting the
field's common abstractions and idioms in its instruction set; and (2)
a <em>compiler toolchain</em>, built on top of <a
href="http://www.llvm.org">LLVM</a>, for turning programs
written for the abstract machine into optimized, natively executable
code.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre>
# cat hello-world.hlt
module Main

import Hilti

void run() {
  call Hilti::print ("Hello, HILTI world!")
}

# hiltic -j hello-world.hlt
Hello, HILTI world!
</pre>
</div>

<h2>About Spicy</h2>

<p>
Spicy (formerly BinPAC++) is a next-generation parser generator that makes it easy to
build parsers for network protocols, file formats, and more. Spicy
is more than just a "yacc for protocols": it's an all-in-one system
that enables developers to write attributed grammars defining both
syntax and semantics of an input format inside a single comprehensive
scripting language.
</p>

<p>
The Spicy toolchain, built on top of HILTI, turns such grammars
into efficient parsing code that exposes an well-defined C interface
to its host application for feeding in input and retrieving results.
At runtime, parsing proceeds fully incrementally&mdash;and potentially
in parallel&mdash;on input streams of arbitrary size. Compilation
takes place either statically at build time, or or just-in-time at
startup.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre>
# cat http-request.pac2
module HTTP;

const Token      = /[^ \t\r\n]+/;
const WhiteSpace = /[ \t]+/;
const NewLine    = /\r?\n/;

export type RequestLine = unit {
  method:  Token;
  :        WhiteSpace;
  uri:     Token;
  :        WhiteSpace;
  version: Version;
  :        NewLine;

  on %done {
    print self.method, self.uri, self.version.number;
    }
};

type Version = unit {
  :       /HTTP\//;
  number: /[0-9]+\.[0-9]+/;
};

# echo "GET /index.html HTTP/1.0" | pac-driver http-request.pac2
GET /index.html 1.0
